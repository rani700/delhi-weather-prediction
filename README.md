## I have predicted	_tempm column values using machine learning models and deep learning models and obtained rmse loss which are shown in below table.


| model name| MSE value on Training set   | MSE value on Test set |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Linear Regression(Univariate)   |  -     |  0.1519       |
| Linear Regression(Multivariate)    | -      |0.1982         | 
| Lasso Regression(Univariate)   |  -     |  0.1635       |
| Lasso Regression(Multivariate)    | -      |0.2215         | 
| LSTM(Univariate)   |  0.1076     |  0.1559      |
| LSTM(Multivariate)    | 0.0728      |0.2064         | 
| LSTM Bidirectional(Univariate)   |  0.1076     |  0.1578      |
| LSTM Bidirectional(Multivariate)    | 0.0808      |0.2178         | 
| SSIM(Univariate)   |  0.1065     |  0.1567       |
| SSIM(Multivariate)    | 0.0617      |0.2258        |
